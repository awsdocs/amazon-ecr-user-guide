# Amazon ECR interface VPC endpoints \(AWS PrivateLink\)<a name="vpc-endpoints"></a>

You can improve the security posture of your VPC by configuring Amazon ECR to use an interface VPC endpoint\. VPC endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a technology that enables you to privately access Amazon ECR APIs through private IP addresses\. AWS PrivateLink restricts all network traffic between your VPC and Amazon ECR to the Amazon network\. You don't need an internet gateway, a NAT device, or a virtual private gateway\.

For more information about AWS PrivateLink and VPC endpoints, see [VPC Endpoints ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

## Considerations for Amazon ECR VPC endpoints<a name="ecr-vpc-endpoint-considerations"></a>

Before you configure VPC endpoints for Amazon ECR, be aware of the following considerations\.
+ To allow your Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances to pull private images from Amazon ECR, ensure that you also create the interface VPC endpoints for Amazon ECS\. For more information, see [Interface VPC Endpoints \(AWS PrivateLink\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/vpc-endpoints.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*\.
**Important**  
Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate don't require the Amazon ECS interface VPC endpoints\.
+ Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate using Linux platform version `1.3.0` or earlier only require the **com\.amazonaws\.*region*\.ecr\.dkr** Amazon ECR VPC endpoint and the Amazon S3 gateway endpoint to take advantage of this feature\.
+ Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate using Linux platform version `1.4.0` or later require both the **com\.amazonaws\.*region*\.ecr\.dkr** and **com\.amazonaws\.*region*\.ecr\.api ** Amazon ECR VPC endpoints as well as the Amazon S3 gateway endpoint to take advantage of this feature\.
+ Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate using Windows platform version `1.0.0` or later require both the **com\.amazonaws\.*region*\.ecr\.dkr** and **com\.amazonaws\.*region*\.ecr\.api ** Amazon ECR VPC endpoints as well as the Amazon S3 gateway endpoint to take advantage of this feature\.
+ Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate that pull container images from Amazon ECR can restrict access to the specific VPC their tasks use and to the VPC endpoint the service uses by adding condition keys to the task execution IAM role for the task\. For more information, see [Optional IAM Permissions for Fargate Tasks Pulling Amazon ECR Images over Interface Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_execution_IAM_role.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*\.
+ Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate that pull container images from Amazon ECR that also use the `awslogs` log driver to send log information to CloudWatch Logs require the CloudWatch Logs VPC endpoint\. For more information, see [Create the CloudWatch Logs endpoint](#ecr-setting-up-cloudwatch-logs)\.
+ The security group attached to the VPC endpoint must allow incoming connections on port 443 from the private subnet of the VPC\.
+ VPC endpoints currently don't support cross\-Region requests\. Ensure that you create your VPC endpoints in the same Region where you plan to issue your API calls to Amazon ECR\.
+ VPC endpoints currently don't support Amazon ECR Public repositories\. Consider using a pull through cache rule to host the public image in a private repository in the same Region as the VPC endpoint\. For more information, see [Using pull through cache rules](pull-through-cache.md)\.
+ VPC endpoints only support AWS provided DNS through Amazon RouteÂ 53\. If you want to use your own DNS, you can use conditional DNS forwarding\. For more information, see [DHCP Options Sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.
+ If your containers have existing connections to Amazon S3, their connections might be briefly interrupted when you add the Amazon S3 gateway endpoint\. If you want to avoid this interruption, create a new VPC that uses the Amazon S3 gateway endpoint and then migrate your Amazon ECS cluster and its containers into the new VPC\.
+ When an image is pulled using a pull through cache rule for the first time, if you've configured Amazon ECR to use an interface VPC endpoint using AWS PrivateLink then you need to create a public subnet in the same VPC, with a NAT gateway, and then route all outbound traffic to the internet from their private subnet to the NAT gateway in order for the pull to work\. Subsequent image pulls don't require this\. For more information, see [Scenario: Access the internet from a private subnet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html#public-nat-internet-access) in the *Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide*\.

### Considerations for Windows images<a name="ecr-vpc-endpoint-windows-considerations"></a>

Images based on the Windows operating system include artifacts that are restricted by license from being distributed\. By default, when you push Windows images to an Amazon ECR repository, the layers that include these artifacts are not pushed as they are considered *foreign layers*\. When the artifacts are provided by Microsoft, the foreign layers are retrieved from Microsoft Azure infrastructure\. For this reason, to enable your containers to pull these foreign layers from Azure additional steps are needed beyond creating the VPC endpoints\.

It is possible to override this behavior when pushing Windows images to Amazon ECR by using the `--allow-nondistributable-artifacts` flag in the Docker daemon\. When enabled, this flag will push the licensed layers to Amazon ECR which enables these images to be pulled from Amazon ECR via the VPC endpoint without additional access to Azure being required\.

**Important**  
Using the `--allow-nondistributable-artifacts` flag does not preclude your obligation to comply with the terms of the Windows container base image license; you cannot post Windows content for public or third\-party redistribution\. Usage within your own environment is allowed\.

To enable the use of this flag for your Docker installation, you must modify the Docker daemon configuration file which, depending on your Docker installation, can typically be configured in settings or preferences menu under the **Docker Engine** section or by editing the `C:\ProgramData\docker\config\daemon.json` file directly\.

The following is an example of the required configuration\. Replace the value with the repository URI you are pushing images to\.

```
{
    "allow-nondistributable-artifacts": [
        "111122223333.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com"
    ]
}
```

After modifying the Docker daemon configuration file, you must restart the Docker daemon before attempting to push your image\. Confirm the push worked by verifying that the base layer was pushed to your repository\.

**Note**  
The base layers for Windows images are large\. The layer size will result in a longer time to push and additional storage costs in Amazon ECR for these images\. For these reasons, we recommend only using this option when it is strictly required to reduce build times and ongoing storage costs\. For example, the `mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore` image is approximately 1\.7 GiB in size when compressed in Amazon ECR\.

## Create the VPC endpoints for Amazon ECR<a name="ecr-setting-up-vpc-create"></a>

To create the VPC endpoints for the Amazon ECR service, use the [Creating an Interface Endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#create-interface-endpoint) procedure in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances require both Amazon ECR endpoints and the Amazon S3 gateway endpoint\.

Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate using platform version `1.4.0` or later require both Amazon ECR VPC endpoints and the Amazon S3 gateway endpoints\.

Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate that use platform version `1.3.0` or earlier only require the **com\.amazonaws\.*region*\.ecr\.dkr** Amazon ECR VPC endpoint and the Amazon S3 gateway endpoints\.

**Note**  
The order that the endpoints are created in doesn't matter\.

**com\.amazonaws\.*region*\.ecr\.dkr**  
This endpoint is used for the Docker Registry APIs\. Docker client commands such as `push` and `pull` use this endpoint\.  
When you create this endpoint, you must enable a private DNS hostname\. To do this, ensure that the **Enable Private DNS Name** option is selected in the Amazon VPC console when you create the VPC endpoint\.

**com\.amazonaws\.*region*\.ecr\.api**  
The specified *region* represents the Region identifier for an AWS Region supported by Amazon ECR, such as `us-east-2` for the US East \(Ohio\) Region\.
This endpoint is used for calls to the Amazon ECR API\. API actions such as `DescribeImages` and `CreateRepository` go to this endpoint\.  
When this endpoint is created, you have the option to enable a private DNS hostname\. Enable this setting by selecting **Enable Private DNS Name** in the VPC console when you create the VPC endpoint\. If you enable a private DNS hostname for the VPC endpoint, update your SDK or AWS CLI to the latest version so that specifying an endpoint URL when using the SDK or AWS CLI isn't necessary\.  
If you enable a private DNS hostname and are using an SDK or AWS CLI version released before January 24, 2019, you must use the `--endpoint-url` parameter to specify the interface endpoints\. The following example shows the format for the endpoint URL\.  

```
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name name --endpoint-url https://api.ecr.region.amazonaws.com
```
If you don't enable a private DNS hostname for the VPC endpoint, you must use the `--endpoint-url` parameter specifying the VPC endpoint ID for the interface endpoint\. The following example shows the format for the endpoint URL\.  

```
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name name --endpoint-url https://VPC_endpoint_ID.api.ecr.region.vpce.amazonaws.com
```

## Create the Amazon S3 gateway endpoint<a name="ecr-setting-up-s3-gateway"></a>

For your Amazon ECS tasks to pull private images from Amazon ECR, you must create a gateway endpoint for Amazon S3\. The gateway endpoint is required because Amazon ECR uses Amazon S3 to store your image layers\. When your containers download images from Amazon ECR, they must access Amazon ECR to get the image manifest and then Amazon S3 to download the actual image layers\. The following is the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the Amazon S3 bucket containing the layers for each Docker image\.

```
arn:aws:s3:::prod-region-starport-layer-bucket/*
```

Use the [Creating a gateway endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-gateway.html#create-gateway-endpoint) procedure in the *Amazon VPC User Guide* to create the following Amazon S3 gateway endpoint for Amazon ECR\. When creating the endpoint, be sure to select the route tables for your VPC\.

**com\.amazonaws\.*region*\.s3**  
The Amazon S3 gateway endpoint uses an IAM policy document to limit access to the service\. The **Full Access** policy can be used because any restrictions that you have put in your task IAM roles or other IAM user policies still apply on top of this policy\. If you want to limit Amazon S3 bucket access to the minimum required permissions for using Amazon ECR, see [Minimum Amazon S3 Bucket Permissions for Amazon ECR](#ecr-minimum-s3-perms)\.

### Minimum Amazon S3 Bucket Permissions for Amazon ECR<a name="ecr-minimum-s3-perms"></a>

The Amazon S3 gateway endpoint uses an IAM policy document to limit access to the service\. To allow only the minimum Amazon S3 bucket permissions for Amazon ECR, restrict access to the Amazon S3 bucket that Amazon ECR uses when you create the IAM policy document for the endpoint\. 

The following table describes the Amazon S3 bucket policy permissions needed by Amazon ECR\.


| Permission | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `arn:aws:s3:::prod-region-starport-layer-bucket/*`  |  Provides access to the Amazon S3 bucket containing the layers for each Docker image\. Represents the Region identifier for an AWS Region supported by Amazon ECR, such as `us-east-2` for the US East \(Ohio\) Region\.  | 

#### Example<a name="ecr-minimum-s3-perms-example"></a>

The following example illustrates how to provide access to the Amazon S3 buckets required for Amazon ECR operations\.

```
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Access-to-specific-bucket-only",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::prod-region-starport-layer-bucket/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Create the CloudWatch Logs endpoint<a name="ecr-setting-up-cloudwatch-logs"></a>

Amazon ECS tasks using the Fargate launch type that use a VPC without an internet gateway that also use the `awslogs` log driver to send log information to CloudWatch Logs require that you create the **com\.amazonaws\.*region*\.logs** interface VPC endpoint for CloudWatch Logs\. For more information, see [Using CloudWatch Logs with interface VPC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/cloudwatch-logs-and-interface-VPC.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide*\.

## Create an endpoint policy for your Amazon ECR VPC endpoints<a name="ecr-vpc-endpoint-policy"></a>

A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint when you create or modify the endpoint\. If you don't attach a policy when you create an endpoint, AWS attaches a default policy for you that allows full access to the service\. An endpoint policy doesn't override or replace IAM user policies or service\-specific policies\. It's a separate policy for controlling access from the endpoint to the specified service\. Endpoint policies must be written in JSON format\. For more information, see [Controlling Access to Services with VPC Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-access.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

We recommend creating a single IAM resource policy and attaching it to both of the Amazon ECR VPC endpoints\.

The following is an example of an endpoint policy for Amazon ECR\. This policy enables a specific IAM role to pull images from Amazon ECR\.

```
{
	"Statement": [{
		"Sid": "AllowPull",
		"Principal": {
			"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/role_name"
		},
		"Action": [
			"ecr:BatchGetImage",
			"ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
                    "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken"
		],
		"Effect": "Allow",
		"Resource": "*"
	}]
}
```

The following endpoint policy example prevents a specified repository from being deleted\.

```
{
	"Statement": [{
			"Sid": "AllowAll",
			"Principal": "*",
			"Action": "*",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Resource": "*"
		},
		{
			"Sid": "PreventDelete",
			"Principal": "*",
			"Action": "ecr:DeleteRepository",
			"Effect": "Deny",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:ecr:region:1234567890:repository/repository_name"
		}
	]
}
```

The following endpoint policy example combines the two previous examples into a single policy\.

```
{
	"Statement": [{
			"Sid": "AllowAll",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": "*",
			"Action": "*",
			"Resource": "*"
		},
		{
			"Sid": "PreventDelete",
			"Effect": "Deny",
			"Principal": "*",
			"Action": "ecr:DeleteRepository",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:ecr:region:1234567890:repository/repository_name"
		},
		{
			"Sid": "AllowPull",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": {
				"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/role_name"
			},
			"Action": [
				"ecr:BatchGetImage",
				"ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
                          "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken"
			],
			"Resource": "*"
		}
	]
}
```
